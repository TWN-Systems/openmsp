# OpenMSP Documentation

This directory contains the documentation that powers OpenMSP. Each section maps to a core capability that small managed service providers can use as a baseline. The pages are currently skeletons and are intended to be fleshed out over time.

## Sections
- [Monitoring & Alerts](monitoring/README.md)
- [Backups](backups/README.md)
- [Security Baselines](security/README.md)
- [Ticketing Flows](ticketing/README.md)
- [Client Documentation Templates](client-docs/README.md)
- [Automation Starters](automation/README.md)
- [Training Resources](training/README.md)

Contributions are welcome. If you have improvements or additional runbooks, please open a pull request.
